There are 2 folders belong to Pycharm, I think, don't know if it needs to stay there or not.
I have a chatclient.py and chatcserver.py, and a credentials.txt saved some credentials I created 
for testing. To run and complie the code, I made it as requested in the document. For example: 
chatserver.py Port (to run the server)
chatclient.py Server Port Username (to run the client)
